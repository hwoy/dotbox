1.AI GAME Interface

[function prototype]

int function_name(struct dbs_game *game,struct dbs_line *line);

[Examples]

int dbf_aiv1_Jarvis(struct dbs_game *game,struct dbs_line *line);


int dbf_aiv2_Friday(struct dbs_game *game,struct dbs_line *line);

[PARAMETERS]
struct dbs_game *game = structure of game
input game information

struct dbs_line *line = strcture of line
output to line

[FUNCTION RETURN]
int = AI ID

[AI ID]

enum
{
ai_best,ai_worse,ai_random,gp_hitscore,gp_doubletab,\
gp_gameover,gp_gamenormal,\
gp_invline,gp_invx,gp_invy,ai_nomove,ai_errmalloc
};

ai_best = 0 == best move at least take one score
ai_worse = 1 == worse move at least lose one score
ai_random = 2 == Move and score not be changed

ai_nomove = 10 == ai can not process for a line, considered for ai bugs
ai_errmalloc = 11 == memory can not be allocated by malloc function

[DESCRIBE]

AI must not modify game data
only process for a line
and return AI ID
